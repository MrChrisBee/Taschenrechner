Cant use me now

Train using Tkinter by creating a calculator
I use grid and try to make use of as much as senseful cool things

actual point is an issue with PhotoImage and the Image attribute in tk.Button
Redesign or reconstruct the add_button so that different actions are taken when the user 
hits + or 5, use a if construct to make the right things
care for a history of what's typed and calculated (how to use it)

What's my strategy to limit the digits, actually its just growing 
when i put to much values in

create tests, this is a good place
