U cant use me now

Train using Tkinter by creating a calculator
I use geometry manager grid and try to make use of as much as senseful cool things (OOP?)

Actual point is an issue with PhotoImage and the Image attribute in tk.Button

What's my strategy to limit the digits, actually its just growing when i put to much values in
