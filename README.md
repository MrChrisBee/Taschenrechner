Calculator (Taschenrechner)

Trying to build a Calculator using tkinter.
I use geometry manager grid and try to make use of as much 
as senseful cool things (OOP!)
Im still learning how a calculator works, try to emulate it as much as i can afford.

Bind keys to buttons.

U cant use me now -- but . it becomes more andd more useful :-)

Actual point is an issue with PhotoImage and the Image attribute in tk.Button
Its not nice now, but it gets useable more and more.

This could not handle (even self created) numbers in scientifically format
