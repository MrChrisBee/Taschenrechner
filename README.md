Calculator (Taschenrechner)

Build a Calculator using tkinter.
I use geometry manager grid and try to make use of as much 
as senseful cool things (OOP!)
Im still learning how a calculator works, try to emulate it as much as i can afford.

Bind keys to buttons.

U can use me now 

This is getting interessting and a little to much timeconsuming, 
but i think its worth all to learn using GUI.

You wanne try?
Git Clone It, navigate in src folder and exexcute 

python Calculator.py
