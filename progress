Defining a Function which creates the Buttons




Main think to do is evaluate (eval()) the String i got from input.
Calculating 5+7= leads to a string containing 5+7 and the evaluation because = was pressend.
The order in which calculation takes place should ensure by Python eval() (* / before -+ and so on)
Worklfow should be type a number, recognizing that it's done when a operation is pressed. If this is = ?
7+          calcstr = "7+"
5*          calcstr = calcstr + "5*"

3=          calcstr = calcstr + "3" (7+5*3)

print(eval("7+5*3")) works as Expected



What is a key on a calculator

    Its a sign and a action when you hit it.
    Sign: 0 .. 9 (numbers) + - * / = (operators)

Using eval is perhalps the easiest way , i want to call a calculation closure if that makes sense

This is limited to +-*/=.
